Installation:
=============
1. Build the shared library libpegasos.so. 
	> tar xvzf jnipegasos.tgz
	> cd Pegasos-JNI
	> cd src/pegasos-native
	(Set the JAVAHOME variable correctly in Makefile)
	> make 
	> make install
2. Now build the Java codes
	> cd ../.. (Top directory Pegasos-JNI)
	> ant -f src/jnipegasos/build.xml

Usage:
======
3. Test the installation
	Unpack the example dataset:
	> cd src/pegasos-native
	> tar xvf data.tgz (creates example/{train.dat,test.dat})
	Run the scripts JNI-Pegasos_train.sh and JNI-Pegasos_test.sh. It 
	basically runs training and classification on an example dataset, 
	given in src/pegasos-native/example, which is provided in original
	pegasos package.

Description:
============
	The software provides a java interface for pegasos algorithm, which 
	is implemented in c++ by Shai Shalev-Shwartz.

	Like SVM-Light and Pegasos, this also takes the data file in same 
	svmlight format. Model file, which is weight vector in primal is also
	written in sparse vector format like in svmlight.
 
	An option has been added to write predicted output into a file, given
	by predicFile argument. Also, two test java files has been provided in
	the top directory named JNIPegasosTrainTest.java and 
	JNIPegasosClassifyTest.java

  	The instances and labels file should be in SVM-Light format.  
	See: http://svmlight.joachims.org/
